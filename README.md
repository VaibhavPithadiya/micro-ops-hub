# MicroOps Hub üöÄ

**MicroOps Hub** is a fully open-source, end-to-end DevOps showcase built around **Java (Spring Boot + Gradle)** microservices, **Postgres**, and **Nginx** ‚Äî automated using **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, and **Kubernetes (Minikube)**.  

It‚Äôs designed as a practical, reproducible example of how modern DevOps workflows can be applied to microservice architecture ‚Äî combining CI/CD, IaC, observability, and security, all in a cost-free local setup.

## üß© Project Overview

This project is a reference full-stack microservices system with DevOps pipeline automation:

| Layer | Tools & Tech | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Application | Java (Spring Boot + Gradle), HTML/JS | Users + Orders microservices + Frontend |
| Gateway | Nginx | Reverse proxy / static content |
| Database | Postgres | Shared datastore |
| CI/CD | Jenkins | Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Deploy |
| IaC | Terraform | Infra & Kubernetes resource management |
| Runtime | Docker + Minikube | Local cluster |
| Security | Trivy, Checkov, Gitleaks | DevSecOps checks |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana | Metrics & dashboards |

## üí° About This Project

Built as a learning and demonstration project by a Java developer exploring complete **DevOps pipelines**, **automation**, and **cloud-native microservices** ‚Äî focused on best practices, scalability, and clarity.  

Every component is designed to run locally without paid services ‚Äî ideal for self-learning and experimentation.
